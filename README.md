# KoraGPT Frontend

> ‚ö°Ô∏è The backend for this project is here: [koragpt_back](https://github.com/kostasmpous/koragpt_back)

KoraGPT is a **Next.js 15 + React 19** client that signs users in, lets them browse their chat history, and talk to large-language-model providers through a single interface.

---

## Layout and State Management

- The custom `_app` wraps every non-auth page with:
    - `AuthProvider`
    - `ProtectedRoute`
    - Left-hand `Sidebar`

  ‚Üí Ensures authenticated screens always share the same layout while `/login` and `/register` stay bare-bones.

- **Authentication state** is stored in `AuthContext`.  
  It:
    - Hydrates tokens from `localStorage`
    - Decorates Axios with the bearer token
    - Exposes login/logout helpers
    - Redirects to `/login` when a session goes missing

---

## Page Tour

- **`/login`** ‚Äì Username/password form that calls the login helper, shows inline errors, and links new users to registration.
- **`/register`** ‚Äì Collects profile details, posts to `/api/auth/signup`, and confirms success before sending users back to the sign-in screen.
- **`/chat/[id]`** ‚Äì Main conversation view:
    - Polls the REST backend for messages
    - Normalises them into assistant/user bubbles
    - Lets you pick an AI provider + model
    - Uses the Composer to send replies to `/api/messages`
- **`/`** ‚Äì Currently an empty placeholder; once logged in you‚Äôll see the sidebar but no main content yet.
- **`/api/hello`** ‚Äì Default Next.js sample endpoint kept from the starter template.

---

## Shared Interface Pieces

- **Sidebar** ‚Äì Loads the signed-in user‚Äôs chats from `/api/chats/users/{userId}/chats`, highlights the active thread, spawns new chats, opens Settings, and provides a logout button.
- **Composer** ‚Äì Grows with your text, sends messages to `/api/messages`, and supports Enter-to-send with optional cancel mid-flight.
- **Settings dialog** ‚Äì Two-tab modal for changing email/password or basic billing/profile details; it pulls the current profile on open and persists edits back to `/api/users/me`.
- **ProtectedRoute** ‚Äì Simple gatekeeper that waits for auth hydration before redirecting unauthenticated visitors to `/login`.

---

## Backend Integration

- All API calls go through `src/lib/api.js`:
    - Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`
    - Automatically attaches the stored bearer token
    - Shares Axios configuration across the app

üëâ Adjust that base URL if your backend runs elsewhere.
